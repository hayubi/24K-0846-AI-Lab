    "In a building with multiple rooms, a firefighting robot has been deployed to save lives and\n",
    "prevent damage. The building is represented by a 3x3 grid, where each cell corresponds to a\n",
    "room. Some rooms contain fires, and others are safe.\n",
    "● The robot starts at room 'a' and must move across all rooms, from 'a' to 'j',\n",
    "detecting and extinguishing any fires along the way.\n",
    "● The robot needs to be aware of which rooms have fire and must extinguish them\n",
    "by changing the room’s status from \"fire\" to \"safe.\"\n",
    "● The robot needs to continuously display the environment’s status after each move\n",
    "and indicate when fires are detected and extinguished.\n",
    "● Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "○ Implement a 3x3 grid where rooms 'a', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h' are safe (no fire),\n",
    "and rooms 'c', 'e', 'j' contain fires.\n",
    "○ The robot starts at room 'a' and follows a predefined path: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd',\n",
    "'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j'].\n",
    "● Robot Movement:\n",
    "○ The robot should move from room to room in the specified path.\n",
    "○ At each room, the robot must check if there is a fire:\n",
    "■ If there is a fire, extinguish it and update the room's status to safe.\n",
    "■ If there is no fire, move to the next room.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Displaying the Environment:\n",
    "○ After each move, display the current status of the environment.\n",
    "○ Use symbols like \" \" for fire and \" \" (space) for a safe room to represent the\n",
    "environment visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "● Final Output:\n",
    "○ After the robot has completed its movement, display the final status of all\n",
    "rooms (with all fires extinguished).\n",
